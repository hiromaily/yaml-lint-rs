# GitHub Issue Creation Rules

When the user asks to create a GitHub issue (e.g., "issueを作成して", "create an issue", "issue追加"), follow these guidelines.

## Project Context

- **Repository**: hiromaily/yaml-lint-rs
- **Purpose**: Fast YAML linter written in Rust, inspired by Python yamllint
- **Structure**: Cargo workspace with `core` (library) and `cli` (binary) crates

### Current Implementation Status

**Implemented Rules (6):**
- trailing-spaces, line-length, document-start, colons, key-duplicates, indentation

**Roadmap:**
- Phase 2: Additional output formats, more rules
- Phase 3: Full yamllint parity (23 rules)
- Phase 4: Parallel linting
- Phase 5: Editor integration (LSP)

## Issue Guidelines

### Title Conventions

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| New Rule | feat: Add rule-name rule | feat: Add truthy rule |
| New Feature | feat: Add feature description | feat: Add colored output format |
| CLI Option | feat: Add --flag option | feat: Add --fix auto-fix option |
| Bug Fix | fix: Brief description | fix: Incorrect line number in error |
| Docs | docs: Description | docs: Add examples for indentation rule |

### Labels

- enhancement - New features and rules
- bug - Bug fixes
- documentation - Documentation improvements

### Required Sections

1. **Summary** - 1-2 sentences describing the change
2. **Motivation** - Why it's needed, who benefits
3. **Proposed Implementation** - Configuration, CLI usage, examples
4. **Implementation Notes** - Technical considerations
5. **Acceptance Criteria** - Checklist of requirements
6. **Priority** - High / Medium / Low with reason

### For New Rules, Include:

- YAML configuration format
- Good/Bad code examples
- Reference to yamllint equivalent rule if applicable
- Which presets it should be added to (default, relaxed)

### Command

Use gh issue create with --label enhancement flag. Format body using HEREDOC.

## Before Creating Issues

1. Check existing issues: gh issue list
2. Understand current implementation by reading relevant files
3. Reference yamllint documentation for rule compatibility
4. Consider implementation complexity and user value
